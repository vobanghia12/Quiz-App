A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

What I did in this project:
- Factor the code when I divided into multiple widgets
- Pass data from main widget to child widget 
- Layout and style for UI
